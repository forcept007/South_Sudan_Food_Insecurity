Most of those displaced cannot find safe drinking water and face malnutrition, with high percentages of children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition in makeshift camps. MSF has set up a sewage treatment plant to contain and treat fecal waste, but urgent action is required by humanitarian actors, donors, and the South Sudanese Government to address shelter, clean water and sanitation infrastructure, quality healthcare, food security and livelihood support needs.

"The article discusses how the humanitarian principle of impartiality is in crisis in South Sudan, where aid is frequently manipulated by political elites. The article warns that a blind focus on needs can intensify the very suffering that aid agencies are trying to address. The authors suggest that instead of taking refuge in purely needs-based interpretations of impartiality, the humanitarian community can commit to a more expansive agenda in which existing principles are complemented by a concern for social injustice and redressing structural inequalities. Conflict sensitivity will help humanitarians navigate and minimize the unintended consequences of their assistance.",2022-08-22,Unity State,8.9277211,29.7889248,18398,Koch
